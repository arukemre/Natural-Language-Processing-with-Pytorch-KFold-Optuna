# Natural Language Processing with Pytorch | KFold | Optuna



### PyTorch 
  - `Pytorch` is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI(facebook).Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.


### K fold Cross Validation
  - `K fold` Cross Validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of your machine learning or deep learning model in a robust way.
  - It splits the dataset into k parts/folds of approximately equal size. Each fold is chosen in turn for testing and the remaining parts for training.
  - This process is repeated k times and then the performance is measured as the mean across all the test sets.
